# CHAPTER I - Of Sigi, the Son of Odin

Here begins the tale, and tells of a man who was named Sigi, and called of 
men the son of Odin; another man withal is told of in the tale, hight
Skadi, a great man and mighty of his hands; yet was Sigi the mightier and
the higher of kin, according to the speech of men of that time. Now Skadi
had a thrall with whom the story must deal somewhat, Bredi by name, who
was called after that work which he had to do; in prowess and might of
hand he was equal to men who were held more worthy, yea, and better than
some thereof.

Now it is to be told that, on a time, Sigi fared to the hunting of the
evening; and when they gathered together their prey in the evening, lo,
greater and more by far was that which Bredi had slain than Sigi's prey;
and this thing he much misliked, and he said that great wonder it was that
a very thrall should out-do him in the hunting of deer: so he fell on him
and slew him, and buried the body of him thereafter in a snow-drift.

Then he went home at evening tide and says that Bredi had ridden away from
him into the wild-wood. "Soon was he out of my sight," he says, "and
naught more I wot of him."

Skadi misdoubted the tale of Sigi, and deemed that this was a guile of
his, and that he would have slain Bredi. So he sent men to seek for him,
and to such an end came their seeking, that they found him in a certain
snow-drift; then said Skadi, that men should call that snow-drift Bredi's
Drift from henceforth; and thereafter have folk followed, so that in such
wise they call every drift that is right great.

Thus it is well seen that Sigi has slain the thrall and murdered him; so
he is given forth to be a wolf in holy places[^1], and may no more abide
in the land with his father; therewith Odin bare him fellowship from the
land, so long a way, that right long it was, and made no stay till he
brought him to certain war-ships. So Sigi falls to lying out a-warring
with the strength that his father gave him or ever they parted; and happy
was he in his warring, and ever prevailed, till he brought it about that
he won by his wars land and lordship at the last; and thereupon he took to
him a noble wife, and became a great and mighty king, and ruled over the
land of the Huns, and was the greatest of warriors. He had a son by his
wife, who was called Refir, who grew up in his father's house, and soon
became great of growth, and shapely.

[^1]: "Wolf in holy places," a man put out of the pale of society for crimes, an outlaw.

# CHAPTER II -  Of the Birth of Volsung, the Son of Rerir, who was the Son of Sigi

Now Sigi grew old, and had many to envy him, so that at last those
turned against him whom he trusted most; yea, even the brothers of his
wife; for these fell on him at his unwariest, when there were few
with him to withstand them, and brought so many against him, that they
prevailed against him, and there fell Sigi and all his folk with him.
But Rerir, his son, was not in this trouble, and he brought together so
mighty a strength of his friends and the great men of the land, that
he got to himself both the lands and kingdom of Sigi his father; and so
now, when he deems that the feet under him stand firm in his rule, then
he calls to mind that which he had against his mother's brothers, who
had slain his father. So the king gathers together a mighty army, and
therewith falls on his kinsmen, deeming that if he made their kinship
of small account, yet none the less they had first wrought evil against
him. So he wrought his will herein, in that he departed not from strife
before he had slain all his father's banesmen, though dreadful the deed
seemed in every wise. So now he gets land, lordship, and fee, and is
become a mightier man than his father before him.

Much wealth won in war gat Rerir to himself, and wedded a wife withal,
such as he deemed meet for him, and long they lived together, but had
no child to take the heritage after them; and ill-content they both were
with that, and prayed the Gods with heart and soul that they might get
them a child. And so it is said that Odin hears their prayer, and Freyia
no less hearkens wherewith they prayed unto her: so she, never lacking
for all good counsel, calls to her her casket-bearing maid, the
daughter of Hrimnir the giant, and sets an apple in her hand, and bids
her bring it to the king. She took the apple, and did on her the gear of
a crow, and went flying till she came whereas the king sat on a mound,
and there she let the apple fall into the lap of the king; but he took
the apple, and deemed he knew whereto it would avail; so he goes home
from the mound to his own folk, and came to the queen, and some deal of
that apple she ate.

So, as the tale tells, the queen soon knew that she big with child, but
a long time wore or ever she might give birth to the child: so it befell
that the king must needs go to the wars, after the custom of kings, that
he may keep his own land in peace: and in this journey it came to pass
that Rerir fell sick and got his death, being minded to go home to Odin,
a thing much desired of many folk in those days.

Now no otherwise it goes with the queen's sickness than heretofore, nor
may she be the lighter of her child, and six winters wore away with the
sickness still heavy on her; so that at the last she feels that she may
not live long; wherefore now she bade cut the child from out of her; and
it was done even as she bade; a man-child was it, and great of growth
from his birth, as might well be; and they say that the youngling kissed
his mother or ever she died; but to him is a name given, and he is
called Volsung; and he was king over Hunland in the room of his father.
From his early years he was big and strong, and full of daring in all
manly deeds and trials, and he became the greatest of warriors, and of
good hap in all the battles of his warfaring.

Now when he was fully come to man's estate, Hrimnir the giant sends to
him Ljod his daughter; she of whom the tale told, that she brought the
apple to Rerir, Volsung's father. So Volsung weds her withal; and long
they abode together with good hap and great love. They had ten sons and
one daughter, and their eldest son was hight Sigmund, and their daughter
Signy; and these two were twins, and in all wise the foremost and the
fairest of the children of Volsung the king, and mighty, as all his seed
was; even as has been long told from ancient days, and in tales of long
ago, with the greatest fame of all men, how that the Volsungs have been
great men and high-minded and far above the most of men both in cunning
and in prowess and all things high and mighty.

So says the story that king Volsung let build a noble hall in such a
wise, that a big oak-tree stood therein, and that the limbs of the tree
blossomed fair out over the roof of the hall, while below stood the
trunk within it, and the said trunk did men call Branstock.

# CHAPTER III -  Of the Sword that Sigmund, Volsung's son, drew from the Branstock

There was a king called Siggeir, who ruled over Gothland, a mighty king
and of many folk; he went to meet Volsung, the king, and prayed him for
Signy his daughter to wife; and the king took his talk well, and his
sons withal, but she was loth thereto, yet she bade her father rule in
this as in all other things that concerned her; so the king took such
rede[^2] that he gave her to him, and she was betrothed to King Siggeir;
and for the fulfilling of the feast and the wedding, was King Siggeir
to come to the house of King Volsung. The king got ready the feast
according to his best might, and when all things were ready, came the
king's guests and King Siggeir withal at the day appointed, and many a
man of great account had Siggeir with him.

The tale tells that great fires were made endlong the hall, and the
great tree aforesaid stood midmost thereof; withal folk say that, whenas
men sat by the fires in the evening, a certain man came into the hall
unknown of aspect to all men; and suchlike array he had, that over him
was a spotted cloak, and he was bare-foot, and had linen-breeches knit
tight even unto the bone, and he had a sword in his hand as he went up
to the Branstock, and a slouched hat upon his head: huge he was, and
seeming-ancient, and one-eyed[^3]. So he drew his sword and smote it
into the tree-trunk so that it sank in up to the hilts; and all held
back from greeting the man. Then he took up the word, and said--

"Whoso draweth this sword from this stock, shall have the same as a gift
from me, and shall find in good sooth that never bare he better sword in
hand than is this."

Therewith out went the old man from the hall, and none knew who he was
or whither he went.

Now men stand up, and none would fain be the last to lay hand to the
sword, for they deemed that he would have the best of it who might first
touch it; so all the noblest went thereto first, and then the others,
one after other; but none who came thereto might avail to pull it out,
for in nowise would it come away howsoever they tugged at it; but now up
comes Sigmund, King Volsung's son, and sets hand to the sword, and pulls
it from the stock, even as if it lay loose before him; so good that
weapon seemed to all, that none thought he had seen such a sword before,
and Siggeir would fain buy it of him at thrice its weight of gold, but
Sigmund said--

"Thou mightest have taken the sword no less than I from there whereas it
stood, if it had been thy lot to bear it; but now, since it has first of
all fallen into my hand, never shalt thou have it, though thou biddest
therefor all the gold thou hast."

King Siggeir grew wroth at these words, and deemed Sigmund had answered
him scornfully, but whereas was a wary man and a double-dealing, he
made as if he heeded this matter in nowise, yet that same evening he
thought how he might reward it, as was well seen afterwards.
